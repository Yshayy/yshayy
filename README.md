### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

<!--
**Yshayy/yshayy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

I'm Yshay, software engineer and co-founder of Livecycle. I've designed and developed software for the last decade   
and I'm passionate about product design, software architecture, technology, programming languages and OSS development. 

ðŸ”¥ I love tinkering with cutting-edge technologies to build great products that deliver real (and new) value to users.  
âœ¨ I enjoy sharing my knowledge with the community by giving talks at local meetups and public events.   
I've spoken on a variety of topics, including UI design, functional and reactive programming, and multi-container architecture.  
ðŸš€ Currently, I'm working on building the next generation of collaboration tools for development teams at Livecycle.
